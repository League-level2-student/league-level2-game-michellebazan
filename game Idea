Ideas For Game

Instead of characters dying when colliding, have it be like a teleport???
So MC running into ___ would take MC to a new place/game state

MC == blob?

blob's goal is to get to the treasure
but has to avoid challenges along the way
time limit

start state - will need to have instructions/goal on it, arrow keys in play, 
would be cool if blob is seen at start state and to start the game the blobs moves to touch the word start
game state - timer starts, game starts, blob could be on a platform, 
end state - fail/success? text differs on whether goal was completed within time limit


another idea - FE Lite - - - - -
requires - 2d arrays???
